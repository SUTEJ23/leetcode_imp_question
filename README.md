# Explanation of code 

🔢 Problem Summary
You're given:

An integer eventTime: the end of the entire event schedule.

Two lists: startTime[] and endTime[], representing the start and end times of several meetings.

An integer k: the maximum number of meetings you are allowed to cancel.

Your goal:
Cancel up to k meetings to maximize the total free time between the meetings (i.e., maximize the sum of time gaps between them).


🔍 Core Idea of the Code
Calculate Gaps:
Compute the time gaps between the end of one meeting and the start of the next.

Add final gap:
If eventTime is after the last meeting, add the gap between the end of the last meeting and eventTime.

Sliding Window:
Use a sliding window of size k+1 to find the maximum sum of k+1 consecutive gaps (since skipping k meetings creates k+1 contiguous free time gaps).

🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Code
python
Copy
Edit
gap = []
s = 0
e = 0

for i in range(len(startTime)):
    if i-1 >= 0:
        e = endTime[i-1]     # end of previous meeting
    s = startTime[i]         # start of current meeting
    gap.append(s - e)        # gap between prev end and current start
👉 This loop builds a list of gaps:

gap[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i-1]

It captures thefree time between consecutive meetings.

python
Copy
Edit
if eventTime != endTime[-1]:
    gap.append(eventTime - endTime[-1])
✅ Adds the final free time after the last meeting (if the last meeting doesn’t reach the end of the event).

python
Copy
Edit
l = 0 
r = 1
ans = gap[0]
res = ans
l and r are the left and right pointers of the sliding window.

Initialize res and ans with the first gap.

🔄 Main Sliding Window Logic:
python
Copy
Edit
while l <= r and r < len(gap):
    if r - l + 1 <= k + 1:
        res = res + gap[r]
    else:
        res = res - gap[l] + gap[r]
        l += 1
    ans = max(ans, res)
    r += 1
📌 Explanation:

Window size is k+1 because removing k meetings allows combining k+1 gaps.

res tracks the sum of the current window of gaps.

If window is valid, just add next gap.

If window is too big, shrink it by sliding l right.

At each step, update ans with the max value of res.

✅ Final Return

return ans
The maximum total free time obtained by canceling up to k meetings.
